    <div class="mbti" id="istp">
        <h1>ISTP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.</p></div>
        <br>
    <div class="mbti" id="isfp">
        <h1>ISFP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Adventurers are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this personality type, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals.</p>

        <h1>ISTJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Logisticians pride themselves on their integrity. People with this personality type mean what they say, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="mbti" id="isfj">
        <h1>ISFJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        This is a capable, can-do personality type, with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, Defenders also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. Defenders are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives.</p>

    <div class="mbti" id="estp">
        <h1>ESTP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="mbti" id="estj">
        <h1>ESTJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.</p>

        <h1>ESFJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        For Consuls, life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. People with this personality type form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.

    <div class="mbti" id="esfp">
        <h1>ESFP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style.</p>
</div>
<br>
    <div class="mbti" id="entp">
        <h1>ENTP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Quick-witted and audacious, Debaters aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up people with this personality type more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better.</p>


    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="mbti" id="entj">
        <h1>ENTJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.</p>
</div>
<br>
    <div class="mbti" id="enfp">
        <h1>ENFP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <p>       Campaigners are true free spirits – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life, they stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, Campaigners don’t just care about having a good time. These personality types run deep – as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people.</p>
</div>
<br>
    <div class="mbti" id="enfj">
        <h1>ENFJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.</p>
</div>
<br>
    <div class="mbti" id="infp">
        <h1>INFP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.</p>
</div>
<br>
    <div class="mbti" id="intp">
        <h1>INTP</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren’t afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p>

    <div class="mbti" id="intj">
        <h1>INTJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.</p>

    <div class="mbti" id="infj">
        <h1>INFJ</h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>        Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.</p>
